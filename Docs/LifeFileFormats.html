      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This document describes some of the file formats used for Game of Life
        and Life-like programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content was assembled from various parts of the internet. Some was
        copied or modified from the MCell <a
          href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/mcell/ca_files_formats.html"
        >Cellular Automata file formats</a> page.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rle">
      <h1>Run Length Encoded (RLE)</h1>
      <p>
        This file is in text format. Lines must not exceed 70 characters
        although it is recommended that reader can handle more than this.
        End of line markers can be in any of the Unix, DOS/Windows or Mac
        styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four distinct sections of the file. In order they are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li># lines</li>
        <li>Header line</li>
        <li>Pattern lines</li>
        <li>Comments</li>
      </ol>
      <h2># lines</h2>
      <p>
        # lines begin with <kbd>#</kbd> followed a letter indicating the type of
        information the line provides. They are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><kbd>C</kbd></dt>
        <dd>
          <div>
            Indicates that a line of comment follows. Example:
          </div>
          <pre class="indent">#C Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</pre>
        </dd>
        <dt><kbd>c</kbd>
        <dd>
          Same as C.
        </dd>
        <dt><kbd>N</kbd></dt>
        <dd>
          <div>
            The name of the pattern. Example:
          </div>
          <pre class="indent">#N My pattern</pre>
        </dd>
        <dt><kbd>O</kbd></dt>
        <dd>
          <div>
            Says when and by whom the file was created. Example:
          </div>
          <pre class="indent">#O John Smith john.smith@example.com Fri Apr 30 19:38:52 2012</pre>
        </dd>
        <dt><kbd>P</kbd></dt>
        <dd>
          <div>
            Essentially the same as <kbd>R</kbd>, below. Coordinates
            representing the top-left corner of the Life pattern.
            <mark title="Clarify this">Relative to top left of grid?</mark>
            Example:
          </div>
          <pre class="indent">#P 90 136</pre>
        </dd>
        <dl><kbd>R</kbd></dl>
        <dd>
          <div>
            Gives the coordinates of the top-left corner of the pattern relative
            to the centre of the grid. Example:
          </div>
          <pre class="indent">#R -22 -57</pre>
        </dd>
        <dl><kbd>r</kbd></dl>
        <dd>
          <div>
            Gives the rules for the pattern in S/B format. The standard method
            of representing rules is in the <em>header line</em> (below), but
            this form is sometimes used instead. Example:
          </div>
          <pre class="indent">#r 23/3</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>Header line</h2>
      <p>
        The header line has the form:
      </p>
      <pre class="indent">x = m, y = n, rule = Baaa/Sbbb</pre>
      <p>
        <kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>rule</kbd> are literal strings.
        <kbd>m</kbd> and <kbd>n</kbd> are numbers giving the width and height of
        the pattern, respectively. <kbd>Baaa/Sbbb</kbd> is the rule's
        designation in the form birth-rule/survival rule. <kbd>aaa</kbd> and
        <kbd>bbb</kbd> are strings of digits from 0 to 8 while <kbd>B</kbd> and
        <kbd>S</kbd> are literal characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <kbd>rule</kbd> part may be omitted, in which case the comma
        preceding it is also omitted. Where no rule is given <a
          href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"
        >Conway's Life</a> (B3/S23) is assumed.
      </p>
      <h2>Pattern lines</h2>
      <p>
        A description of the pattern begins on the line following the header
        line. It is encoded as a sequence if items of the form
      </p>
      <pre class="indent">&lt;run_count&gt;&lt;tag&gt;</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        &lt;tag&gt; is one of the following:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><kbd>b</kbd></dt>
        <dd>a dead cell</dd>
        <dt><kbd>o</kbd></dt>
        <dd>a live cell</dd>
        <dt><kbd>$</kbd></dt>
        <dd>end of a line of the pattern</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <kbd>&lt;run_count&gt;</kbd> is the number of occurrences of
        <kbd>&lt;tag&gt;</kbd> and can be omitted if is equal to 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last <kbd>&lt;run_count&gt;&lt;tag&gt;</kbd> pair is followed by a
        <kbd>!</kbd> character. Dead cells at the end of a pattern line do not
        need to be encoded and neither does the end of the last line of the
        pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whitespace is permitted between <kbd>&lt;run_count&gt;&lt;tag&gt;</kbd>
        items and before the terminating <kbd>!</kbd>. It is not permitted to
        place whitespace in the middle of a
        <kbd>&lt;run_count&gt;&lt;tag&gt;</kbd> item, although readers should be
        able to handle this.
      </p>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Anything after the final <kbd>!</kbd> is ignored and can be used for
        comments. However <kbd>#C</kbd> lines are more usually used for this
        purpose (see above).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="life-105">
      <h1>Life 1.05 &amp; XLife 2.0</h1>
      <p>
        The XLife 2.0 file format is closely related to Life 1.05 and differs
        from it only slightly. The following text describes Life 1.05 with any
        differences in XLife 2.0 noted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an ASCII text format. Lines may not exceed 80 characters.
        End of line is denoted by the MS-DOS / Windows format of CR followed by
        LF. Files usually have the <kbd>.LIF</kbd> extension or <kbd>.life</kbd>
        for XLife 2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first line of the file is a header that identifies the format. It
        is:
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <kbd>#Life 1.05</kbd>
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          In theory, a lower number is acceptable for this format, but it's not
          clear what these formats may be.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        After the header are optional description lines which begin with
        <kbd>#D</kbd> in Life 1.05 or <kbd>#C</kbd> in XLife 2.0. This is
        followed by no more than 78 characters of text. Leading and trailing
        spaces are ignored. For example, the following two lines are equivalent:
      </p>
      <pre class="indent">#D Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
#D    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</pre>
      <p>
        There should be no more than 22 <kbd>#D</kbd>  lines in the
        file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next comes an optional rule specification. If no rules are specified
        the pattern will run with whatever rule the Life program is currently
        using. There are two forms of the rule specification:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <kbd>#R</kbd>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This specifies the required rule in S/B format. For example
          <kbd>#R&nbsp;23/3</kbd> for <a
            href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"
          >Conway's Life</a> or
          <kbd>#R&nbsp;23/36</kbd> for <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HighLife"
          >HighLife</a>.
        </dd>
        <dl>
          <kbd>#N</kbd>
        </dl>
        <dd>
          <kbd>#N</kbd> appears on its own and is simply a short way of
          specifying <a
            href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"
          >Conway's Life</a>. It is equivalent to <kbd>#R&nbsp;23/3</kbd>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The next part of the file contains information about the cells. There is
        one or more &quot;cell blocks&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each cell block starts with a <kbd>#P</kbd> line, where the
        <kbd>#P</kbd> is followed by the (x,y) coordinates of the upper left
        hand corner of the cell block, where (0,0) is the center of the current
        window to the Life universe. For example <kbd>#P&nbsp;-1 4</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <kbd>#P</kbd> line is followed by one of more lines that define the
        state of the cells in the block. Each line describes a row of the block
        with <kbd>.</kbd> (a dot) representing an &quot;off&quot; cell and
        <kbd>*</kbd> representing &quot;on&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blank lines are represented by a single <kbd>.</kbd> (dot). Any other
        line may truncate all dots to the right of the last <kbd>*</kbd>. Any
        blank line is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no limit to the number of lines in a cell block, but the file's
        80 character width limit applies to the row width.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default extension is <kbd>.life</kbd> instead of <kbd>.LIF</kbd>.
      </p>

    <section id="life-106">
      <h1>Life 1.06</h1>
      <p>
        This is an ASCII file format that simply lists the coordinates of the
        alive cells.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          File size can be very large for large patterns.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        The file begins with the following header line:
      </p>
      <pre class="ident">#Life 1.06</pre>
      <p>
        Immediately after the header is the list of cell coordinates in the
        form <kbd>x&nbsp;y</kbd>. Each coordinate is placed on its own line.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="plaintext">
      <h1>Plaintext</h1>
      <p>
        This is an ASCII file format with no restriction on line length.
      </p>
      <p>
        The file begins with comment lines which begin with <kbd>!</kbd>. Some
        command lines are special and begin with a &quot;keyword&quot;. These
        are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><kbd>!Name:</kbd></dt>
        <dd>
          <div>The name of the pattern. For example:</div>
          <pre class="indent">!Name: My pattern</pre>
        </dd>
        <dt><kbd>!Author:</kbd></dt>
        <dd>
          <div>The name of the pattern author. For example:</div>
          <pre class="indent">!Author: John Smith</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        All other comment lines are read literally. For example:
      </p>
      <pre class="indent">! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</pre>
      <p>
        Empty comment lines, with just a single <kbd>!</kbd> are permitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The description of the pattern follows the last comment line. Each line
        of the file describes a row of the pattern with a <kbd>.</kbd> (dot)
        representing an &quot;off&quot; cell and an <kbd>O</kbd> (capital letter
        &quot;o&quot;) for an &quot;on&quot; cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any trailing &quot;off&quot; cells may be omitted from a line. Blank
        rows are indicated by blank lines.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Given that this format is based on Life 1.05, it may be safe to treat
          a single <kbd>.</kbd> (dot) on a line on its own as a blank row.
        </p>
