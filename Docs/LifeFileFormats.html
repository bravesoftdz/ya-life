        This document describes the various file formats used for Game of Life
        and Life-like programs.

      <h1>Life 1.05 Format</h1>
      <p>
        This file is in text format <mark title="query this">(ASCII?)</mark>.
        Lines may not exceed 80 characters. End of line is denoted by the MS-DOS
        / Windows format of CR followed by LF. Files usually have the
        <kbd>.LIF</kbd> extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first line of the file is a header that identifies the format. It
        is:
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <kbd>#Life 1.05</kbd>
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          In theory, a lower number is acceptable for this format, but it's not
          clear what these formats may be.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        After the header are optional description lines which begin with
        <kbd>#D</kbd> and are followed by no more than 78 characters of text.
        Leading and trailing spaces are ignored. For example, the following two
        lines are equivalent:
      </p>
      <pre class="indent">#D This is a Description line
#D    This is a Description line</pre>
      <p>
        There should be no more than 22 <kbd>#D</kbd>  lines in the
        file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next comes an optional rule specification.  If no rules are specified
        the pattern will run with whatever rule the Life program is currently
        using. There are two forms of the rule specification:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <kbd>#R</kbd>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This specifies the required rule in S/B format. For example
          <kbd>#R&nbsp;23/3</kbd> for <a
            href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"
          >Conway's Life</a> or
          <kbd>#R&nbsp;23/36</kbd> for <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HighLife"
          >HighLife</a>.
        </dd>
        <dl>
          <kbd>#N</kbd>
        </dl>
        <dd>
          <kbd>#N</kbd> appears on its own and is simply a short way of
          specifying <a
            href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"
          >Conway's Life</a>. It is equivalent to <kbd>#R&nbsp;23/3</kbd>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The next part of the file contains information about the cells. There is
        one or more &quot;cell blocks&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each cell block starts with a <kbd>#P</kbd> line, where the
        <kbd>#P</kbd> is followed by the (x,y) coordinates of the upper left
        hand corner of the cell block, where (0,0) is the center of the current
        window to the Life universe. For example <kbd>#P&nbsp;-1 4</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <kbd>#P</kbd> line is followed by one of more lines that define the
        state of the cells in the block. Each line describes a row of the block
        with <kbd>.</kbd> (a dot) representing an &quot;off&quot; cell and
        <kbd>*</kbd> representing &quot;on&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blank lines are represented by a single <kbd>.</kbd> (dot). Any other
        line may truncate all dots to the right of the last <kbd>*</kbd>. Any
        blank line is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no limit to the number of lines in a cell block, but the file's
        80 character width limit applies to the row width.
      </p>
      <h2>Xlife compatibility</h2>
      <p>
        Xlife recognizes the symbol <kbd>#C</kbd> (for <kbd>C</kbd>omment)
        instead of <kbd>#D</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default extension is <kbd>.life</kbd> instead of <kbd>.LIF</kbd>.
