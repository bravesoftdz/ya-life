# YaLife: Yet Another Life Program #

## Overview ##
This is a **brand new project** to write a cellular automata simulator for the Game of Life and associated "Life-like" automata.

Delphi (Object Pascal) is the language of choice.

YaLife is a hobby project that has its roots in some code written as a competition entry back in 1992.

There may be little or nothing here for a while until I get the project up and running. I'm not expecting a first release for quite a while!
