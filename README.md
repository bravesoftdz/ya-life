This project started out as a Game Of Life implementation. It has pretty much been abandoned in its early stages and has only arrived on GitHub because of GoogleCode's announced closure.

**Please don't raise any issues or ask questions** - I'm no longer interested in this project.

If anyone wants to take it over or wants to grab any code, please fork away!
